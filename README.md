# Data-Structures
This is just a basic time based testing program for data structures and algorithms within a templated class. It is a work in progress, but eventually it will handle many differnt types and additional algorithms.
To run the program, just add an integer value to the first console argument. This will create a sorted(using sort() from #include algorithm) and an unsorted unsigned int vector of the size specfified. I wanted to make sure that the sorted and unsorted were both of the same exact values for running the tests on the different lists. Using the build in sort() function assured that no errors were in place prior to my testing beginning. This allows for a better representation when comparing the different times.
